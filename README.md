I introduce Certified Rubbish, a solution aimed at ensuring waste in the UK is managed responsibly and sustainably. With incidents of fly-tipping on the rise and the government spending a fortune on clean-ups, our dual model combines a directory of over 150,000 waste carriers with a SaaS compliance tool that uses blockchain technology for tamper-proof records. The market opportunity is significant, with a £9 billion industry and a projected £47 million in recurring revenue at just 10% market penetration. We’ve already seen an 80% adoption rate in our pilot in Manchester, and I encourage you to engage with our platform to help restore public trust in waste management. Let's work together to disrupt this sector not just in the UK, but globally.
