            <h2>What is a Waste Carrier License?</h2>
            <p>
              A waste carrier license is a legal requirement for any business or individual who transports controlled waste in England and Wales. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Commercial waste removal companies</li>
              <li>Skip hire businesses</li>
              <li>Construction companies removing waste from sites</li>
              <li>Scrap metal dealers</li>
              <li>Any business that transports waste as part of their operations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Registration</h2>

            <h3>Upper Tier Registration</h3>
            <p>
              Required for businesses that regularly transport waste as their main business activity or as a significant part of their business. This registration:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Costs Â£154 and lasts for 3 years</li>
              <li>Requires renewal every 3 years</li>
              <li>Involves checks on the business and key personnel</li>
              <li>May require evidence of professional competence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lower Tier Registration</h3>
            <p>
              Suitable for businesses that only transport their own waste occasionally. This registration:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is free of charge</li>
              <li>Lasts indefinitely (no renewal required)</li>
              <li>Has simpler requirements</li>
              <li>Cannot be used for carrying waste as a commercial service</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Register</h2>
            <p>
              Registration is done through the Environment Agency's online portal. You'll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your business details and company registration number</li>
              <li>Details of key personnel</li>
              <li>Information about the types of waste you'll carry</li>
              <li>Payment details (for upper tier registration)</li>
              <li>Evidence of professional competence (if required)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Penalties for Operating Without a License</h2>
            <p>
              Operating without proper registration is a criminal offense. Penalties can include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unlimited fines</li>
              <li>Up to 5 years imprisonment</li>
              <li>Seizure of vehicles</li>
              <li>Damage to business reputation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Checking a Carrier's License</h2>
            <p>
