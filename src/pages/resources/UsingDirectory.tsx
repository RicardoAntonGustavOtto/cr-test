            <h2>Why Use Our Directory?</h2>
            <p>

            <ul>

            <h2>How to Search the Directory</h2>

            <h3>Search by Location</h3>
            <p>
              The most common way to find carriers is by location:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the <Link to="/search-results" className="text-primary hover:underline">Directory page</Link></li>
              <li>Enter your postcode, town, or county in the search box</li>
              <li>Browse the results to find carriers operating in your area</li>
              <li>Click on a carrier to view full details</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Search by Company Name</h3>
            <p>
              If you know the company name or want to verify a specific carrier:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Use the search box to enter the company name</li>
              <li>Results will show all matching carriers</li>
              <li>Look for exact matches or similar names</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Search by Registration Number</h3>
            <p>
              To verify a carrier who has provided their registration number:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Enter the registration number in the search box</li>
              <li>View the full details to confirm it matches their information</li>
              <li>Check the registration is current and not expired</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Understanding Carrier Listings</h2>

            <h3>Registration Status</h3>
            <p>
              Each listing shows the carrier's current status:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Active:</strong> Currently registered and authorized to operate</li>
              <li><strong>Expired:</strong> Registration has lapsed - DO NOT USE</li>
              <li><strong>Suspended:</strong> Registration temporarily suspended - DO NOT USE</li>
              <li><strong>Revoked:</strong> Registration canceled by the Environment Agency - DO NOT USE</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Registration Details</h3>
            <p>
              Carrier listings include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Registration Number:</strong> Unique identifier (usually starts with CBDU or CBDL)</li>
              <li><strong>Company Name:</strong> Official registered business name</li>
              <li><strong>Trading Name:</strong> Name the business operates under (if different)</li>

              <li><strong>Expiry Date:</strong> When the registration expires</li>
              <li><strong>Business Address:</strong> Registered office location</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Registration Types Explained</h3>

            <h4>Upper Tier Carriers</h4>
            <p>
              These carriers can transport waste commercially:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Authorized to collect waste from others</li>
              <li>Pay a registration fee (Â£154 for 3 years)</li>
              <li>Subject to checks and conditions</li>
              <li>Must demonstrate professional competence</li>
              <li>Suitable for hiring waste collection services</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Lower Tier Carriers</h4>
            <p>
              These carriers can only transport their own waste:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free registration that doesn't expire</li>
              <li>Cannot offer waste collection services commercially</li>
              <li>Limited to moving their own business waste</li>
              <li><strong>NOT suitable for hiring waste collection</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Carrier</h2>

            <h3>What to Look For</h3>
            <p>
              When selecting a carrier from the directory:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Check Status:</strong> Must be "Active"</li>
              <li><strong>Verify Type:</strong> Must be "Upper Tier" for commercial collections</li>
              <li><strong>Check Expiry:</strong> Should have significant time before expiry</li>
              <li><strong>Location:</strong> Operates in or near your area</li>
              <li><strong>Business Details:</strong> Professional listing with complete information</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Additional Research</h3>
            <p>
              Beyond the directory, also consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Online Reviews:</strong> Check Google, Trustpilot, or other review sites</li>
              <li><strong>Website:</strong> Professional carriers usually have a website</li>
              <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Ask about public liability and waste carriers insurance</li>
              <li><strong>Experience:</strong> How long they've been operating</li>
              <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Some carriers specialize in certain waste types</li>
              <li><strong>Accreditations:</strong> Membership of trade bodies or additional certifications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Before You Hire</h2>

            <h3>Initial Contact</h3>
            <p>
              When you contact a carrier from the directory:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Confirm their registration number matches the directory</li>
              <li>Describe your waste clearly and honestly</li>
              <li>Ask where they'll take the waste</li>
              <li>Request a written quote</li>
              <li>Ask about documentation they'll provide</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Quotes</h3>
            <p>
              For the best results:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contact at least 3 carriers for quotes</li>
              <li>Provide the same information to each for fair comparison</li>
              <li>Get quotes in writing</li>
              <li>Ask about any additional charges</li>
              <li>Don't automatically choose the cheapest</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>"Can you confirm your Environment Agency registration number?"</li>
              <li>"What specific services do you offer?"</li>
              <li>"Where will you dispose of the waste?"</li>
              <li>"What documentation will you provide?"</li>
              <li>"Do you have public liability insurance?"</li>
              <li>"What happens if you can't collect on the agreed date?"</li>
              <li>"Are there any items you cannot take?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>After Collection</h2>

            <h3>Required Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              Always obtain and keep:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Waste Transfer Note:</strong> For business waste (legal requirement)</li>
              <li><strong>Receipt:</strong> For household waste (proof of collection)</li>
              <li><strong>Contact Details:</strong> Carrier's name, address, and registration number</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Keep Records</h3>
            <p>
              Store documentation for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Households:</strong> At least 2 years (recommended)</li>
              <li><strong>Businesses:</strong> Minimum 2 years (legal requirement)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This protects you if your waste is later found to be fly-tipped.
            </p>

            <h2>Reporting Problems</h2>

            <h2>Directory Limitations</h2>

            <h3>What the Directory Can't Tell You</h3>
            <p>
              The directory provides official registration data, but cannot guarantee:
            </p>

              <li>Quality of service</li>
              <li>Pricing competitiveness</li>
              <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
              <li>Availability in specific postcodes</li>
              <li>Specialist capabilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <em>You should still do your own research and due diligence before hiring.</em>
            </p>
