## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Technology Stack (Observed)
- **Framework**: React (based on div#root structure)
- **Analytics**: Google Tag Manager / Google Analytics (AW-17489002151)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility classes observed)
- **Rendering**: Client-side JavaScript (explains why WebFetch couldn't capture full content)

### Dynamic Content
Most individual resource pages are rendered client-side using JavaScript, which prevented complete content capture through standard HTML fetching. The full HTML structure and navigation was preserved from the main resources page.
